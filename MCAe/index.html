        ENTRANCE INFORMATION
      </h2>
  
      <p>
        MCA is a time bound 2nd Yr. (4th-sem.) & 3rd Yr. (6th-sem.) course, approved by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) and conducted by almost all the Universities of India. The selection of the students is based on a written test. The aspiring students with Bachelor's or equivalent degree thereof with minimum of 50% to 60% (subject to notification) are eligible. (This apart, candidates appearing for Bachelor's degree can also apply). Some Universities may also need mathematics at the graduation level eg delhi university, Hyderabad central university The entrance test mainly consists of Mathematics, and Logical and Analytical Reasoning. In some universities, the knowledge of Elementary English and Computer Awareness is also examined. Everywhere, there is a paucity of admissible seats, owing to high-caliber competitions. Hence, mainly those students who figure out in the topmost priorities are able to procure the assured seats. <br>
        Exactly with these intentions to tailor the students to capture the high profile MCA seats, INFOMATHS INDIA (a provenly pioneer institution which has annexed the umpteen proportions of seats at various premier MCA entrance tests, consistently with an accelerating success rate beyond 80% for all the several years since its inception with an incredible passion) has been conducting MEGALEAP - the time bound preparatory course for MCA ENTRANCE TEST for admission to the various premier institutions of India.

        COURSE PROFILE
      </h3>
  
      <p>
        Any Student desirous of doing MCA from a good University/Institute is eligible to apply for this course. Different Eligibility Criterions are to be met for different courses at infomaths i.e.

      <p>
        The time duration for different courses are different. The Course Curriculum includes adequate number of regular classroom sessions along with periodic tests and follow up discussions. The institute maintains its distinctness from other similar coaching centers by engaging the students with sufficiently suitable assignment problems for home practice apart from the classroom lectures by professional experts in the respective fields. Barring this, the center arranges periodic tests as well as quick follow- up discussions enabling the students with the wide opportunity to interact closely with the teachers of the faculty. It has a double advantage. On the one hand, it consolidates a student's competence to deal with tricklish and twisted questions and on the other hand boosts up his confidence satisfactorily. Further more, monthly tests are religiously conducted even after the regular course period in order to help the student remain always in touch with detailed and exhaustive test-topics. To sum up, the teaching members of the institute treat every entrance test-aspiring examinee with great academic personal care.
